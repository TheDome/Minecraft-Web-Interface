# Minecraft-Web-Interface
A Interface to manage a Minecraft server with McMyAdmin

This Interface should allow Users to manage a Minecraft Server.
At the end it should be used to modify the Minecraft Server with McMyAdmin, 'crontab', 'apt' or other linux tools. It should be essentially usable to change the version of the Minecraft Server cause McMyAdmin can't do it.

My skill level in PHP is not the best, so I would appreciate it, if you report me, if the is a mistake in my Code. For me it is also great, if you give me suggestions, how to make the code better.

For execution, I use <a href="https://www.vagrantup.com">Vagrant</a> in combination with <a href="http://www.virtualbox.org">Virtualbox<a/>. The Vagrant environment is in the Repositry. As box, you need <code>ubuntu/trusty64</code>. Then only run "vagrant up"
